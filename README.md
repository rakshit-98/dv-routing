CS 118 Project 2: Simple Distance Vector Routing Protocol

The purpose of this project is to implement, validate and demonstrate a simple Distance Vector protocol of the type that might be used by Peer to Peer, Adhoc, Wireless Sensor or Internet of Things communication devices. We use UDP Sockets and the C/C++ programming language to build a distance vector routing protocol that implements the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Usage

    $ make
    $ ./start-router
    $ ./inject "Hello, world"
